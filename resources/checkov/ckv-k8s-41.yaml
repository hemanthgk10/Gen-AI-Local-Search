  #### Description
  The default service account should not be used to ensure that rights granted to applications can be more easily audited and reviewed. By default the `default` ServiceAccount allows for its service account token to be mounted in pods in its namespace.

  So, ensure that Service Account Tokens are only mounted where necessary.

  #### Rationale
  Kubernetes provides a default service account which is used by cluster workloads where no specific service account is assigned to the pod.
  Where access to the Kubernetes API from a pod is required, a specific service account should be created for that pod, and rights granted to that service account.
  The default service account should be configured such that it does not provide a service account token and does not have any explicit rights assignments.

  #### Remediation
  By default the `default` ServiceAccount allows for its service account token to be mounted in pods in its namespace. Instead, create explicit service accounts wherever a Kubernetes workload requires specific access to the Kubernetes API server.

  Modify the configuration of each default service account to include this value to prevent kubernetes from auto mounting the serviceAccount token.

  ```yaml
  automountServiceAccountToken: false
  ```

  For example,

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: ServiceAccount
  metadata:
    name: build-robot
  automountServiceAccountToken: false

  ---
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: my-pod
  spec:
    serviceAccountName: build-robot
    automountServiceAccountToken: false
  ```
