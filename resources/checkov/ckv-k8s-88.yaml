    Kubernetes is an open source platform for orchestrating containers. A container is a technology that lets you bundle and isolate applications with their entire runtime environment so that it’s easy to move the contained application between stages (development, production, etc.) and environments (on-premise, public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud, or multicloud) while retaining full functionality.

    The Kubernetes API is the front end of the Kubernetes control plane and is how users interact with their Kubernetes cluster. The API (application programming interface) server determines if a request is valid and then processes it.

    Users access the Kubernetes API using kubectl, client libraries, or by making REST requests. Both human users and Kubernetes service accounts can be authorized for API access.

    Setting the Flags `--insecure-bind-address` and `--insecure-port` to **127.0.0.1:8080**, makes the Kubernetes APIs accessible from the node itself but it is still recommended to be disabled.

    #### Description
    Kubernetes is an open source platform for orchestrating containers. A container is a technology that lets you bundle and isolate applications with their entire runtime environment so that it’s easy to move the contained application between stages (development, production, etc.) and environments (on-premise, public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud, or multicloud) while retaining full functionality.

    The Kubernetes API is the front end of the Kubernetes control plane and is how users interact with their Kubernetes cluster. The API (application programming interface) server determines if a request is valid and then processes it.

    Users access the Kubernetes API using kubectl, client libraries, or by making REST requests. Both human users and Kubernetes service accounts can be authorized for API access.

    Setting the Flags `--insecure-bind-address` and `--insecure-port` to **127.0.0.1:8080**, makes the Kubernetes APIs accessible from the node itself but it is still recommended to be disabled.

    #### Rationale
    Setting up the apiserver to serve on an insecure port would allow unauthenticated and unencrypted access to your master node. This would allow attackers who could access this port, to easily take control of the cluster.

    #### Audit
    Run the following command on the master node:
    ```
     ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
    ```
    Verify that the `--insecure-port` argument is set to `0`.

    #### Remediation
    Edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the master node and set the below parameter.
    ```
      --insecure-port=0
    ```

    By default, the insecure port is set to 8080.

    Example:
    ```yaml
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Pod
      metadata:
        annotations:
          scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/critical-pod: ""
        labels:
          component: kube-apiserver
          tier: control-plane
        name: kube-apiserver
        namespace: kube-system
      spec:
        containers:
        - command:
          - kube-apiserver
          - --admission-control=Initializers,NamespaceLifecycle,LimitRanger,ServiceAccount,PersistentVolumeLabel,DefaultStorageClass,DefaultTolerationSeconds,NodeRestriction,ResourceQuota
          - --etcd-servers=http://127.0.0.1:2379
          - --authorization-mode=Node,RBAC
          - --admission-control-config-file=admission-config.yaml
          - --enable-admission-plugins=NodeRestriction,NamespaceLifecycle,LimitRanger,ServiceAccount,DefaultStorageClass,DefaultTolerationSeconds,MutatingAdmissionWebhook,ValidatingAdmissionWebhook,Priority,ResourceQuota
    -     - --insecure-bind-address=0.0.0.0
    -     - --insecure-port=8080
    +     - --insecure-port=0
          ...
          ...

          image: gcr.io/google_containers/kube-apiserver-amd64:v1.8.0
          livenessProbe:
            failureThreshold: 8
            httpGet:
              host: 127.0.0.1
              path: /healthz

            requests:

          volumeMounts:
          - mountPath: /etc/kubernetes/pki

            readOnly: true
          ...
          ...
    ```

    #### Impact
    All components that use the API must connect via the secured port, authenticate themselves, and be authorized to use the API.

    This includes:
      * kube-controller-manager
      * kube-proxy
      * kube-scheduler
      * kubelets
