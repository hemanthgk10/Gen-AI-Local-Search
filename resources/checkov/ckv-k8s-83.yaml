    Kubernetes has emerged as the de facto standard in container orchestrators thanks to its flexibility, scalability, and ease of use. Kubernetes also provides a range of features that secure production workloads. A more recent introduction in security features is a set of plugins called `admission controllers.`

    An admission controller is a piece of code that intercepts requests to the Kubernetes API server prior to persistence of the object, but after the request is authenticated and authorized. The controllers consist of the [list](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#what-does-each-admission-controller-do), are compiled into the kube-apiserver binary, and may only be configured by the cluster administrator.

    The Kubernetes API server flag `disable-admission-plugins` takes a comma-delimited list of admission control plugins to be disabled, even if they are in the list of plugins enabled by default.

    The `NamespaceLifecycle` admission controller ensures that objects cannot be created in non-existent namespaces, and that namespaces undergoing termination are not used for creating the new objects.

    #### Description
    Kubernetes has emerged as the de facto standard in container orchestrators thanks to its flexibility, scalability, and ease of use. Kubernetes also provides a range of features that secure production workloads. A more recent introduction in security features is a set of plugins called `admission controllers.`

    An admission controller is a piece of code that intercepts requests to the Kubernetes API server prior to persistence of the object, but after the request is authenticated and authorized. The controllers consist of the [list](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#what-does-each-admission-controller-do), are compiled into the kube-apiserver binary, and may only be configured by the cluster administrator.

    The Kubernetes API server flag `disable-admission-plugins` takes a comma-delimited list of admission control plugins to be disabled, even if they are in the list of plugins enabled by default.

    The `NamespaceLifecycle` admission controller ensures that objects cannot be created in non-existent namespaces, and that namespaces undergoing termination are not used for creating the new objects.

    #### Rationale
    Make sure to not have `NamespaceLifecycle` in `--disable-admission-plugins` flag. This is recommended to enforce the integrity of the namespace termination process and also for the availability of the newer objects.

    #### Audit
    Run the following command on the master node:
    ```
     ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
    ```
    Verify that the `--disable-admission-plugins` argument is set to a value that does not includes `NamespaceLifecycle`.

    #### Remediation
    Edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the master node and ensure that the `--disable-admission-plugins` parameter is set to a value that does not include `NamespaceLifecycle`.

    By default, `NamespaceLifecycle` is not set.

    Example:
    ```yaml
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Pod
      metadata:
        annotations:
          scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/critical-pod: ""
        labels:
          component: kube-apiserver
          tier: control-plane
        name: kube-apiserver
        namespace: kube-system
      spec:
        containers:
        - command:
          - kube-apiserver
          - --admission-control=Initializers,NamespaceLifecycle,LimitRanger,ServiceAccount,PersistentVolumeLabel,DefaultStorageClass,DefaultTolerationSeconds,NodeRestriction,ResourceQuota
          - --etcd-servers=http://127.0.0.1:2379

          - --kubelet-certificate-authority=/etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt
          - --authorization-mode=Node,RBAC
          - --admission-control-config-file=admission-config.yaml
          - --enable-admission-plugins=SecurityContextDeny,LimitRanger,ServiceAccount,DefaultStorageClass,DefaultTolerationSeconds,MutatingAdmissionWebhook,ValidatingAdmissionWebhook,Priority,ResourceQuota
    -     - --disable-admission-plugins=NamespaceLifecycle
          ...
