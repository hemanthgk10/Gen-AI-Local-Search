  #### Description
  AWS MQ is a managed message broker service that allows software applications and components to communicate using various programming languages, operating systems, and formal messaging protocols. These brokers might contain the sensitive information of the application, so we should ensure that is not publicly exposed.

  #### Rationale
  Ensure that the AWS MQ brokers are not publicly accessible from the Internet in order to avoid exposing sensitive data to meet compliance and security requirements.

  #### Remediation
  Set the `publicly_accessible` to false

  ```
  resource "aws_mq_broker" "example" {
      broker_name = "example"
      configuration {
        id       = aws_mq_configuration.test.id
        revision = aws_mq_configuration.test.latest_revision
      }
      engine_type         = "ActiveMQ"
      engine_version      = "5.15.0"
      host_instance_type  = "mq.t2.micro"
      security_groups     = [aws_security_group.test.id]
  +   publicly_accessible = false
      ...
      ...
  }
  ```

  CloudFormation example:
  ```json
  {
    "Type" : "AWS::AmazonMQ::Broker",
    "Properties" : {
        "BrokerName" : "example",
  +     "PubliclyAccessible" : false,
        ...
        ...
      }
  }
  ```
