description: "Ensure that LABEL maintainer is used instead of MAINTAINER (deprecated)"
guidelines: |-
    #### Description
    The `MAINTAINER` instruction sets the author field of the generated images. But the `LABEL` instruction is much more flexible version of this.

    #### Rationale
    `LABEL` is a key-value pair instead of a single value field like `MAINTAINER`.  An image can have more than one `LABEL`, which helps to assign more metadata to the container image.

    #### Remediation
    Use `LABEL` instruction rather than `MAINTAINER` in the dockerfile.

    Dockerfile example:
    ```
      FROM ubuntu:18.04
    - MAINTAINER support@lacework.com
    + LABEL owner=Lacework \
            version=1.0.0 \
            email=support@lacework.com
      RUN wget http://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.20.2.tar.gz
      RUN tar -xzvf nginx-1.20.2.tar.gz

      WORKDIR nginx-1.20.2
      ...
      ...
      RUN make && make install
    ```
