    Kubernetes is an open source platform for orchestrating containers. A container is a technology that lets you bundle and isolate applications with their entire runtime environment so that it’s easy to move the contained application between stages (development, production, etc.) and environments (on-premise, public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud, or multicloud) while retaining full functionality.

    The Kubernetes API is the front end of the Kubernetes control plane and is how users interact with their Kubernetes cluster. The API (application programming interface) server determines if a request is valid and then processes it.

    Kubernetes auditing provides a security-relevant, chronological set of records documenting the sequence of actions in a cluster. The cluster audits the activities generated by users, by applications that use the Kubernetes API, and by the control plane itself.

    Audit records begin their lifecycle inside the kube-apiserver component. Each request on each stage of its execution generates an audit event, which is then pre-processed according to a certain policy and written to a backend. The policy determines what's recorded and the backends persist the records.

    Enable auditing on the Kubernetes API Server and set the desired audit log path. Retain these logs for at least 30 days or as appropriate.

    #### Description
    Kubernetes is an open source platform for orchestrating containers. A container is a technology that lets you bundle and isolate applications with their entire runtime environment so that it’s easy to move the contained application between stages (development, production, etc.) and environments (on-premise, public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud, or multicloud) while retaining full functionality.

    The Kubernetes API is the front end of the Kubernetes control plane and is how users interact with their Kubernetes cluster. The API (application programming interface) server determines if a request is valid and then processes it.

    Kubernetes auditing provides a security-relevant, chronological set of records documenting the sequence of actions in a cluster. The cluster audits the activities generated by users, by applications that use the Kubernetes API, and by the control plane itself.

    Audit records begin their lifecycle inside the kube-apiserver component. Each request on each stage of its execution generates an audit event, which is then pre-processed according to a certain policy and written to a backend. The policy determines what's recorded and the backends persist the records.

    Enable auditing on the Kubernetes API Server and set the desired audit log path. Retain these logs for at least 30 days or as appropriate.

    #### Rationale
    Retaining logs for at least 30 days ensures that you can go back in time and investigate or correlate any events. Set your audit log retention period to 30 days or as per your business requirements.

    #### Audit
    Run the following command on the master node:
    ```
     ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
    ```
    Verify that the `--audit-log-maxage` argument is set to `30` or as appropriate.

    #### Remediation
    Edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the master node and set the `--audit-log-maxage` parameter to `30` or as an appropriate number of days:
    ```
      --audit-log-maxage=30
    ```

    By default, auditing is not enabled.

    Example:
    ```yaml
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Pod
      metadata:
        annotations:
          scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/critical-pod: ""

    #### CIS Controls
    **Version 6**

    6.3 Ensure Audit Logging Systems Are Not Subject To Loss (i.e. rotation/archive) -- Ensure that all systems that store logs have adequate storage space for the logs generated on a regular basis, so that log files will not fill up between log rotation intervals. The logs must be archived and digitally signed on a periodic basis.

    **Version 7**
    6.4 Ensure adequate storage for logs -- Ensure that all systems that store logs have adequate storage space for the logs generated.
