description: "Ensure the last USER is not root"
guidelines: |-
    #### Description
    Create a non-root user for the container in the Dockerfile for the container image. We should not use the `root` as the last user.

    #### Rationale
    It is a good practice to run the container as a non-root user, if possible. Though user namespace mapping is now available, if a user is already defined in the container image, the container is run as that user by default and specific user namespace remapping is not required.

    #### Remediation
    Ensure that the Dockerfile for the container image contains below instruction:

    ```
    USER <username or ID>
    ```
    where `username or ID` refers to the user that could be found in the container base image. If there is no specific user created in the container base image, then add a `useradd` command to add the specific user before `USER` instruction.

    Dockerfile example:
    ```
      FROM node:12-alpine
      RUN apk add --no-cache python2 g++ make
    + USER root
      WORKDIR /app
      COPY . .
    - USER root
      # Create a user group 'xyzgroup'
    + RUN addgroup -S xyzgroup

      # Create a user 'appuser' under 'xyzgroup'
    + RUN adduser -S -D -h /app/src appuser xyzgroup

      # Chown all the files to the app user.
    + RUN chown -R appuser:xyzgroup /app

      # Switch to 'appuser'
    + USER appuser

      RUN yarn install --production
      HEALTHCHECK --interval=5m --timeout=3s CMD curl -f http://localhost/ || exit 1
      EXPOSE 3000
      CMD ["node", "src/index.js"]
    ```

    Note: The last user used in the dockerfile should not be the `root` user.

    #### Default Value
    By default, the containers are run with `root` privileges and as user `root` inside the container.
