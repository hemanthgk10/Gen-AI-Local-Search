description: Ensure MySQL database 'local_infile' flag is set to 'off'
extra:
  entity: google_sql_database_instance
  type: resource
guidelines: |-
  #### Description
  It is recommended to set the `local_infile` database flag for a Cloud SQL MySQL instance to off.

  #### Rationale
  The `local_infile` flag controls the server-side LOCAL capability for LOAD DATA statements. Depending on the `local_infile` setting, the server refuses or permits local data loading by clients that have LOCAL enabled on the client side.

  To explicitly cause the server to refuse LOAD DATA LOCAL statements (regardless of how client programs and libraries are configured at build time or runtime), start mysqld with local_infile disabled. local_infile can also be set at runtime.

  Due to security issues associated with the `local_infile` flag, it is recommended to disable it. This recommendation is applicable to MySQL database instances.

  #### Remediation
  By default `local_infile` is `on`, so turn it `off`.

  Terraform example
  ```
  resource "google_sql_database_instance" "master" {
      name             = "master-instance"
      database_version = "POSTGRES_11"
      region           = "us-central1"

      settings {
        tier = "db-f1-micro"
        database_flags {
  -         name  = "local_infile"
  -         value = "on"
        }
      }
      ...
      ...
  }
  ```

  Using *Console*
  1. Go to the [Cloud SQL Instances page](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances)
  2. Select the MySQL instance where the database flag needs to be enabled.
  3. Click `Edit`.
  4. Scroll down to the `Flags` section.
  5. To set a flag that has not been set on the instance before, click `Add item`, choose the flag `local_infile` from the drop-down menu, and set its value to `off`.
  6. Click `Save`.
  7. Confirm the changes under `Flags` on the Overview page.

  Using *CLI*
  1. List all Cloud SQL database instances using the following command
  ```
  gcloud sql instances list
  ```
  2. Configure the `local_infile` database flag for every Cloud SQL Mysql database instance using the below command
  ```
  gcloud sql instances patch INSTANCE_NAME --database-flags local_infile=off

  Note:
    This command will overwrite all database flags that were previously set. To keep those and add new ones, include the values for all flags to be set on the instance; any flag not specifically included is set to its default value. For flags that do not take a value, specify the flag name followed by an
    equals sign ("=").
  ```

  #### Impact
  Disabling `local_infile` makes the server refuse local data loading by clients that have LOCAL enabled on the client side.

  #### Notes

  ```
  "WARNING: This patch modifies database flag values, which may require the instance to be restarted. Check the list of supported flags -
  https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/flags - to see if your instance will be restarted when this patch is submitted.
  Note: some database flag settings can affect instance availability or stability, and remove the instance from the Cloud SQL SLA. For information about these flags, see Operational Guidelines."
  Note: Configuring the above flag restarts the Cloud SQL instance.
