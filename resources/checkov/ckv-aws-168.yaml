    #### Description
    Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) offers a secure, durable, and available hosted queue that lets you integrate and decouple distributed software systems and components.

    There are two ways to give your users permissions to your Amazon SQS resources: using the Amazon SQS policy system and using the IAM policy system.

    #### Rationale
    AWS SQS queue can contain sensitive information, so it should be restricted from public access / access to everyone.

    #### Remediation
    Do not set the `Principal` in the access policy to `*`. This will enable access to everyone.

    Terraform example
    ```
    resource "aws_sqs_queue_policy" "test" {
        queue_url = aws_sqs_queue.q.id
        policy = <<POLICY
        {
          "Version": "2012-10-17",
          "Id": "sqspolicy",
          "Statement": [
            {
              "Sid": "First",
              "Effect": "Allow",
    -         "Principal": "*",
    +             "Principal": {
    +             "AWS": [
    +                "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:test-user"
    +             ]},
              "Action": "sqs:SendMessage",
              "Resource": "${aws_sqs_queue.q.arn}",
              "Condition": {
                "ArnEquals": {
                  "aws:SourceArn": "${aws_sns_topic.example.arn}"
                }
              }
            }
          ]
        }
        POLICY
    }
    ```
