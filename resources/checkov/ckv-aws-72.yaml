  entity: aws_sqs_queue_policy

guidelines: |-
    #### Description
    Ensure SQS policies that allow all(*) actions are not created. SQS policies should start with a minimum set of actions and include more as needed rather than starting with `*`.

    #### Remediation
    Providing all actions when unnecessary exposes resources to potentially unwanted actions.

    #### Rationale
    Remove Action with `*` and replace it with specific action that is required.

    Terraform example:
    ```
    resource "aws_sqs_queue_policy" "test" {
        queue_url = ["https://sqs:us-east-2.amazonaws.com/444455556666/example-queue"]
        policy = <<POLICY
        {
          "Version": "2012-10-17",
          "Id": "sqspolicy",
          "Statement": [
            {
              "Sid": "First",
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Principal": "*",
    -         "Action": "*"
    +         "Action": [ "sqs:SendMessage", "sqs:ReceiveMessage" ],
              "Resource": "${aws_sqs_queue.q.arn}",
              ...
              ...
            }
          ]
        }
        POLICY
    }
    ```

    CloudFormation example:
    ```json
    {
      "Type" : "AWS::SQS::QueuePolicy",
      "Properties" : {
          "Queues" : [ "https://sqs:us-east-2.amazonaws.com/444455556666/example-queue" ]
          "PolicyDocument" : {
            "Statement":[{
    -         "Action": "*",
    +         "Action": ["SQS:SendMessage", "SQS:ReceiveMessage"],
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:us-east-2:444455556666:queue2",
              "Principal": {
                "AWS": [ "arn:aws:iam::444455556666:user/example-user" ]
              }
              ...
              ...
            }]
         }
      }
    }
    ```
