    Kubernetes is an open source platform for orchestrating containers. A container is a technology that lets you bundle and isolate applications with their entire runtime environment so that it’s easy to move the contained application between stages (development, production, etc.) and environments (on-premise, public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud, or multicloud) while retaining full functionality.

    Kubernetes uses a popular key-value pair datastore (ETCD) for persisting the data in the cluster.

    ETCD is a strongly consistent, distributed key-value store that provides a reliable way to store data that needs to be accessed by a distributed system or cluster of machines.

    Kubernetes API server is the entry point for storing/retrieving the data from ETCD in a cluster. As ETCD might have sensitive information like tokens etc, so it should be configured to make use of TLS encryption for client connections.

    #### Description
    Kubernetes is an open source platform for orchestrating containers. A container is a technology that lets you bundle and isolate applications with their entire runtime environment so that it’s easy to move the contained application between stages (development, production, etc.) and environments (on-premise, public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud, or multicloud) while retaining full functionality.

    Kubernetes uses a popular key-value pair datastore (ETCD) for persisting the data in the cluster.

    ETCD is a strongly consistent, distributed key-value store that provides a reliable way to store data that needs to be accessed by a distributed system or cluster of machines.

    Kubernetes API server is the entry point for storing/retrieving the data from ETCD in a cluster. As ETCD might have sensitive information like tokens etc, so it should be configured to make use of TLS encryption for client connections.

    #### Rationale
    ETCD objects are sensitive in nature and should be protected by client authentication. This requires the API server to identify itself to the etcd server using a SSL Certificate Authority file.

    #### Audit
    Run the following command on the master node:
    ```
     ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
    ```
    Verify that the `--etcd-cafile` argument exists and it is set as appropriate.

    #### Remediation
    Follow the Kubernetes documentation and set up the TLS connection between the apiserver and etcd. Then, edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the master node and set the etcd certificate authority file parameter.
    ```
        --etcd-cafile=<path/to/ca-file>
    ```

    By default, `--etcd-cafile` is not set.

    Example:
    ```yaml
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Pod
      metadata:
        annotations:
          scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/critical-pod: ""
        labels:
          component: kube-apiserver
          tier: control-plane
        name: kube-apiserver
        namespace: kube-system
      spec:

          - --tls-cert-file=/etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver.crt
          - --tls-private-key-file=/etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver.key
    +     - --etcd-ca-file=/etc/etcd/pki/ca.crt
          ...

    ```

    #### Impact
    TLS and client certificate authentication must be configured for etcd.

    #### CIS Controls:
    **Version 6**
      14.2 *Encrypt All Sensitive Information Over Less-trusted Networks* -- All communication of sensitive information over less-trusted networks should be encrypted. Whenever information flows over a network with a lower trust level, the information should be encrypted.

    **Version 7**
      14.4 *Encrypt All Sensitive Information in Transit* -- Encrypt all sensitive information in transit.
