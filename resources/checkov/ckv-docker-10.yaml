    #### Description
    The `WORKDIR` instruction sets the working directory for any `RUN`, `CMD`, `ENTRYPOINT`, `COPY` and `ADD` instructions that follow it in the Dockerfile. If the `WORKDIR` doesn’t exist, it will be created even if it’s not used in any subsequent Dockerfile instruction.

    #### Rationale
    The `WORKDIR` instruction can be used multiple times in a Dockerfile. If a relative path is provided, it will be relative to the path of the previous `WORKDIR` instruction.

    It is ideal to use the absolute paths to avoid mistakes.

    #### Remediation
    Ensure that WORKDIR values are absolute paths

    Dockerfile example:
    ```
      FROM node:12-alpine
      RUN apk add --no-cache python2 g++ make
      USER root
    + WORKDIR /app
      COPY . .

      ...
      ...
    ```

    #### Default Value
    If the `WORKDIR` doesn’t exist, it will be created even if it’s not used in any subsequent Dockerfile instruction.
