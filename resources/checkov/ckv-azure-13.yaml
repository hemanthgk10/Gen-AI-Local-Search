  #### Description
  Azure App Service Authentication is a feature that can prevent anonymous HTTP requests from reaching the API app, or authenticate those that have tokens before they reach the API app. If an anonymous request is received from a browser, App Service will redirect to a logon page. To handle the logon process, a choice from a set of identity providers can be made, or a custom authentication mechanism can be implemented.

  #### Rationale
  By Enabling App Service Authentication, every incoming HTTP request passes through it before being handled by the application code. It also handles authentication of users with the specified provider(Azure Active Directory, Facebook, Google, Microsoft Account, and Twitter), validation, storing and refreshing of tokens, managing the authenticated sessions and injecting identity information into request headers.

  #### Impact
  When it's enabled, every incoming HTTP request passes through it before being handled by the application code. So that an extra level of authentication process will be added to HTTP requests made to the app.


  #### Remediation
  Set the `auth_settings.enabled` equals to `true`.

  Terraform example:
  ```
  resource "azurerm_app_service" "example" {
      name                = "example-app-service"
      location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
      resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
      app_service_plan_id = azurerm_app_service_plan.example.id

      site_config {
        dotnet_framework_version = "v4.0"
        scm_type                 = "LocalGit"
      }
  +   auth_settings {
  +     enabled = true
  +     ...
  +     ...
  +   }
      ...
      ...
  }
  ```

  Using Console:
    1. Login to Azure Portal using https://portal.azure.com
    2. Go to App Services
    3. Click on each App
    4. Under Setting section, Click on Authentication / Authorization
    5. Set App Service Authentication to On
    6. Choose other parameters as per your requirement and Click on Save


  Using Command Line:
  To set App Service Authentication for an existing app, run the following command:

  ```
   az webapp auth update --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> --name <APP_NAME> --enabled true
  ```

  In order to access `App Service Authentication` settings for Web app using Microsoft API requires `Website Contributor` permission at subscription level. A custom role can be created in place of `website contributor` to provide more specific permission and maintain the principle of least privileged access.
  By default, App Service Authentication is disabled when a new app is created using the command-line tool or Azure Portal console.

  #### Additional Information
  You're not required to use App Service for authentication and authorization. Many web frameworks are bundled with security features, and you can use them if you like. If you need more flexibility than App Service provides, you can also write your own utilities. Secure authentication and authorization require deep understanding of security, including federation, encryption, JSON web tokens (JWT) management, grant types, and so on.
