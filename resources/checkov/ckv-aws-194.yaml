    #### Description
    AWS AppSync provides a robust, scalable GraphQL interface for application developers to combine data from multiple sources, including Amazon DynamoDB, AWS Lambda, and HTTP APIs.

    AWS AppSync provides powerful GraphQL schema editing through the AWS AppSync console, including automatic GraphQL schema generation from DynamoDB and efficient data caching.

    Using AWS AppSync, you can use GraphQL to request data from the cloud. There are often times when you want to get more information about the execution of your API.

    #### Rationale
    To help debug issues / audit related to request execution of your GraphQL API, you can enable Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor API calls.

    #### Remediation
    Set the `field_log_level` in `aws_appsync_graphql_api` log config.

    Terraform example
    ```
    resource "aws_appsync_graphql_api" "example" {
        authentication_type = "API_KEY"
        name                = "example"

        log_config {
           cloudwatch_logs_role_arn = ${aws_iam_role.example.arn}
    +      field_log_level          = "ERROR"
        }
        ...
        ...
    }
    ```

    CloudFormation example
    ```json
    {
      "Type" : "AWS::AppSync::GraphQLApi",
      "Properties" : {
          "Name": "managed-rule-example",
          "LogConfig": {
             "CloudWatchLogsRoleArn" : "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789:key/6f815f63-e628-448c",
             "ExcludeVerboseContent" : true,
    +        "FieldLogLevel" : "ERROR"
          }
          ...
          ...
      }
    }
