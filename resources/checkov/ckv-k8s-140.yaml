    Kubernetes is an open source platform for orchestrating containers. A container is a technology that lets you bundle and isolate applications with their entire runtime environment so that it’s easy to move the contained application between stages (development, production, etc.) and environments (on-premise, public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud, or multicloud) while retaining full functionality.

    kubelet is the primary "node agent" that runs on each node in a Kubernetes cluster. The kubelet works in terms of a PodSpec. A PodSpec is a YAML or JSON object that describes a pod. The kubelet takes a set of PodSpecs that are provided through various mechanisms (primarily through the apiserver) and ensures that the containers described in those PodSpecs are running and healthy.

    By default, requests to the kubelet's HTTPS endpoint that are not rejected by other configured authentication methods are treated as anonymous requests, and given a username of `system:anonymous` and a group of `system:unauthenticated`. It is recommended to use certificate based authentication.

    #### Description
    Kubernetes is an open source platform for orchestrating containers. A container is a technology that lets you bundle and isolate applications with their entire runtime environment so that it’s easy to move the contained application between stages (development, production, etc.) and environments (on-premise, public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud, or multicloud) while retaining full functionality.

    kubelet is the primary "node agent" that runs on each node in a Kubernetes cluster. The kubelet works in terms of a PodSpec. A PodSpec is a YAML or JSON object that describes a pod. The kubelet takes a set of PodSpecs that are provided through various mechanisms (primarily through the apiserver) and ensures that the containers described in those PodSpecs are running and healthy.

    By default, requests to the kubelet's HTTPS endpoint that are not rejected by other configured authentication methods are treated as anonymous requests, and given a username of `system:anonymous` and a group of `system:unauthenticated`. It is recommended to use certificate based authentication.

    #### Rationale
    The connections from the apiserver to the kubelet are used for fetching logs for pods, attaching (through kubectl) to running pods, and using the kubelet’s port-forwarding functionality. These connections terminate at the kubelet’s HTTPS endpoint. By default, the apiserver does not verify the kubelet’s serving certificate, which makes the connection subject to man-in-the-middle attacks, and unsafe to run over untrusted and/or public networks. Enabling Kubelet certificate authentication ensures that the apiserver could authenticate the Kubelet before submitting any requests.

    #### Audit
    Run the following command on each node:
    ```
     ps -ef | grep kubelet
    ```
    Verify that the `--client-ca-file` argument exists and is set to the location of the client certificate authority file.

    If the `--client-ca-file` argument is not present, check that there is a Kubelet config file specified by `--config`, and that the file sets `authentication: x509: clientCAFile` to the location of the client certificate authority file.

    #### Remediation
    If using a Kubelet config file, edit the file to set `authentication: x509: clientCAFile` to the location of the client CA file.

    If using executable arguments, edit the kubelet service file `/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf` on each worker node and set the below parameter in `KUBELET_AUTHZ_ARGS` variable.
    ```
        --client-ca-file=<path/to/client-ca-file>
    ```

    Based on your system, restart the `kubelet` service. For example:
    ```
       systemctl daemon-reload
       systemctl restart kubelet.service
    ```

    By default, `--client-ca-file` argument is not set.

    Example of Kubelet Configuration file:
    ```yaml
         apiVersion: kubelet.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
         kind: KubeletConfiguration
         address: 0.0.0.0
         authentication:
            anonymous:
              enabled: false
    +       x509:
    +         clientCaFile: "/etc/pf9/kube.d/certs/kubelet/server/ca.crt"
         evictionHard:
            memory.available:  "200Mi"
         podCIDR: 10.200.0.0/16
         authorization:
            mode: Webhook
         maxPods: 200
         readOnlyPort: 0
         ...
         ...
    ```

    #### Impact
    You require TLS to be configured on apiserver as well as kubelets.
