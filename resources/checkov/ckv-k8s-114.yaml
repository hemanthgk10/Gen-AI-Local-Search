    Kubernetes is an open source platform for orchestrating containers. A container is a technology that lets you bundle and isolate applications with their entire runtime environment so that it’s easy to move the contained application between stages (development, production, etc.) and environments (on-premise, public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud, or multicloud) while retaining full functionality.

    The Kubernetes scheduler is a control plane process which assigns Pods to Nodes. The scheduler determines which Nodes are valid placements for each Pod in the scheduling queue according to constraints and available resources.

    Kubernetes scheduler has an option of `Profiling`, which can help to debug any issues or bottle necks. Profiling is the act of analyzing the performance of an applications. It is recommended to disable this `profiling` option, if not needed.

    #### Description
    Kubernetes is an open source platform for orchestrating containers. A container is a technology that lets you bundle and isolate applications with their entire runtime environment so that it’s easy to move the contained application between stages (development, production, etc.) and environments (on-premise, public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud, or multicloud) while retaining full functionality.

    The Kubernetes scheduler is a control plane process which assigns Pods to Nodes. The scheduler determines which Nodes are valid placements for each Pod in the scheduling queue according to constraints and available resources.

    Kubernetes scheduler has an option of `Profiling`, which can help to debug any issues or bottle necks. Profiling is the act of analyzing the performance of an applications. It is recommended to disable this `profiling` option, if not needed.

    #### Rationale
    Profiling allows for the identification of specific performance bottlenecks. It generates a significant amount of program data that could potentially be exploited to uncover system and program details. If you are not experiencing any bottlenecks and do not need the profiler for troubleshooting purposes, it is recommended to turn it off to reduce the potential attack surface.

    #### Audit
    Run the following command on the master node:
    ```
     ps -ef | grep kube-scheduler
    ```
    Verify that the `--profiling` argument is set to `false`.

    #### Remediation
    Edit the Scheduler pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml` file on the master node and set the below parameter.

    By default, profiling is enabled.

    Example:
    ```yaml
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Pod
      metadata:
        labels:
          component: kube-scheduler
          tier: control-plane
        name: kube-scheduler
        namespace: kube-system
      spec:
        containers:
        - command:
          - /usr/local/bin/kube-scheduler
          - --address=0.0.0.0
          - --leader-elect=false
    +     - --profiling=false
            ...
            ...
          image: k8s.gcr.io/kube-scheduler:v1.9.7
          name: kube-scheduler
          volumeMounts:
          - mountPath: /var/ssl
            name: varssl
            readOnly: true
          - mountPath: /etc/openssl
            name: etcopenssl
            readOnly: true
          - mountPath: /etc/pki
            name: etcpki
            readOnly: true
        hostNetwork: true
        volumes:
        - hostPath:
            path: /var/ssl
          name: varssl
        - hostPath:
            path: /etc/openssl
          name: etcopenssl
        - hostPath:
            path: /etc/pki
          name: etcpki
        ...
        ...
    ```

    #### Impact
    Profiling information would not be available.
