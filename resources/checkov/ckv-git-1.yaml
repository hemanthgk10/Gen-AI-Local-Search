  #### Description
  Github allows Owners to set a projectâ€™s visibility as *public* or *private*. These visibility levels affect who can see the project.
  It is extremely critical to make sure to keep it *private* unless it is intended for public access.

  #### Rationale
  Ensuring a repository is private is critical to any Organization as there are chances of leaking of business logic, vulnerabilities in
  your code, secrets if any accidentally got merged to the code.

  #### Remediation
  Set the `private` argument to `true`.

  Terraform example:
  ```
  resource "github_repository" "example" {
      name        = "example"
      description = "My awesome codebase"
  +   private = true
      template {
        owner = "github"
        repository = "terraform-module-template"
      }
      ...
      ...
  }
  ```
