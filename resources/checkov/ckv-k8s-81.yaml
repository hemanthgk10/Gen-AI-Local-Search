    #### Description
    Kubernetes has emerged as the de facto standard in container orchestrators thanks to its flexibility, scalability, and ease of use. Kubernetes also provides a range of features that secure production workloads. A more recent introduction in security features is a set of plugins called `admission controllers.`

    An admission controller is a piece of code that intercepts requests to the Kubernetes API server prior to persistence of the object, but after the request is authenticated and authorized. The controllers consist of the [list](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#what-does-each-admission-controller-do), are compiled into the kube-apiserver binary, and may only be configured by the cluster administrator.

    The Kubernetes API server flag `enable-admission-plugins` takes a comma-delimited list of admission control plugins to invoke prior to modifying objects in the cluster.

    The `SecurityContextDeny` admission controller will deny any pod that attempts to set certain escalating [SecurityContext](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.21/#securitycontext-v1-core) fields.

    #### Rationale
    SecurityContextDeny can be used to provide a layer of security for clusters which do not have PodSecurityPolicies enabled.

    #### Audit
    Run the following command on the master node:
    ```
     ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
    ```
    Verify that the `--enable-admission-plugins` argument is set to a value that includes `SecurityContextDeny`.

    #### Remediation
    Edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the master node and set the `--enable-admission-plugins` parameter to include `SecurityContextDeny`.

    By default, `SecurityContextDeny` is not set.

    Example:
    ```yaml
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Pod
      metadata:
        annotations:
          scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/critical-pod: ""
        labels:
          component: kube-apiserver
          tier: control-plane
        name: kube-apiserver
        namespace: kube-system
      spec:
        containers:
        - command:
          - kube-apiserver
          - --admission-control=Initializers,NamespaceLifecycle,LimitRanger,ServiceAccount,PersistentVolumeLabel,DefaultStorageClass,DefaultTolerationSeconds,NodeRestriction,ResourceQuota
          - --etcd-servers=http://127.0.0.1:2379
          - --kubelet-client-certificate=/etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-kubelet-client.crt
          - --kubelet-client-key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-kubelet-client.key
          - --kubelet-certificate-authority=/etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt
          - --authorization-mode=Node,RBAC
          - --admission-control-config-file=admission-config.yaml
    -     - --enable-admission-plugins=NamespaceLifecycle,LimitRanger,ServiceAccount,DefaultStorageClass,DefaultTolerationSeconds,MutatingAdmissionWebhook,ValidatingAdmissionWebhook,Priority,ResourceQuota
    +     - --enable-admission-plugins=SecurityContextDeny,NamespaceLifecycle,LimitRanger,ServiceAccount,DefaultStorageClass,DefaultTolerationSeconds,MutatingAdmissionWebhook,ValidatingAdmissionWebhook,Priority,ResourceQuota
          ...
          ...

          image: gcr.io/google_containers/kube-apiserver-amd64:v1.8.0
          livenessProbe:
            failureThreshold: 8
            httpGet:
              host: 127.0.0.1
              path: /healthz
              port: 6443
              scheme: HTTPS
            initialDelaySeconds: 15
            timeoutSeconds: 15
          name: kube-apiserver
          resources:
            requests:
              cpu: 250m
          volumeMounts:
          - mountPath: /etc/kubernetes/pki
            name: k8s-certs
            readOnly: true
          ...
          ...
    ```

    #### Impact
    This admission controller should only be used where Pod Security Policies cannot be used on the cluster, as it can interact poorly with certain Pod Security Policies.
