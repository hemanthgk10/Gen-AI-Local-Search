    #### Description
    AWS Backup is a fully-managed service that makes it easy to centralize and automate data protection across AWS services, in the cloud, and on premises. It is a policy expression that defines when, how and for what AWS resources, you want to back up.

    #### Rationale
    AWS Backup helps in reducing risk for data loss or service availability, as we can use the backups to restore the service or data.

    #### Remediation
    Make sure that each EBS volumes have an AWS Backup plan enabled.

    Terraform example
    ```
    resource "aws_ebs_volume" "example" {
      availability_zone = "us-west-2a"
      size              = 40
      ...
      ...
    }

    resource "aws_backup_selection" "example" {
        iam_role_arn = aws_iam_role.example.arn
        name         = "tf_example_backup_selection"
        plan_id      = aws_backup_plan.example.id
        resources = [
           aws_rds_cluster.default.arn,
    +      aws_ebs_volume.example.arn,
        ]
        ...
        ...
    }
    ```
