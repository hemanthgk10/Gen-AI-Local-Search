description: Ensure SQL database 'contained database authentication' flag is set to
  'off'
extra:
  entity: google_sql_database_instance
  type: resource
guidelines: |-
  #### Description
  It is recommended to set `contained database authentication database` flag for Cloud SQL on the SQL Server instance is set to `off`.

  #### Rationale
  A contained database includes all database settings and metadata required to define the database and has no configuration dependencies on the instance of the Database Engine where the database is installed. Users can connect to the database without authenticating a login at the Database Engine level. Isolating the database from the Database Engine makes it possible to easily move the database to another instance of SQL Server. Contained databases have some unique threats that should be understood and mitigated by SQL Server Database Engine administrators. Most of the threats are related to the USER WITH PASSWORD authentication process, which moves the authentication boundary from the Database Engine level to the database level, hence this is recommended to disable this flag. This recommendation is applicable to SQL Server database instances.

  #### Remediation

  Terraform example
  ```
  resource "google_sql_database_instance" "master" {
      name             = "master-instance"
      database_version = "POSTGRES_11"
      region           = "us-central1"

      settings {
        tier = "db-f1-micro"
        database_flags {
  +         name  = "contained database authentication"
  +         value = "off"
        }
      }
      ...
      ...
  }
  ```

  Using *Console*
  1. Go to the [Cloud SQL Instances page](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances)
  2. Select the PostgreSQL instance where the database flag needs to be enabled.
  3. Click `Edit`.
  4. Scroll down to the `Flags` section.
  5. To set a flag that has not been set on the instance before, click `Add` item, choose the flag `contained database authentication` from the drop-down menu and set a value to `off`.
  6. Click `Save`.
  7. Confirm the changes under `Flags` on the Overview page.

  Using *CLI*
  1. List all Cloud SQL database instances using the following command
  ```
  gcloud sql instances list
  ```
  2. Configure the `contained database authentication` flag for every Cloud SQL PosgreSQL database instance using the below command.
  ```
   gcloud sql instances patch INSTANCE_NAME --database-flags "contained database authentication=off"

   Note: This command will overwrite all database flags previously set. To keep those and add new ones, include the values for all flags to be set on the instance; any flag not specifically included is set to its default value. For flags that do not take a value, specify the flag name followed by an equals sign ("=").
  ```


  #### Impact
  When `contained database authentication` is `off` (0) for the instance, contained databases cannot be created, or attached to the Database Engine.

  #### Notes
  ```
  WARNING: This patch modifies database flag values, which may require your instance to be restarted. Check the list of supported flags - https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/sqlserver/flags - to see if your instance will be restarted when this patch is submitted.
  Note: Some database flag settings can affect instance availability or stability, and remove the instance from the Cloud SQL SLA. For information about these flags, see Operational Guidelines.
  Note: Configuring the above flag does not restart the Cloud SQL instance.
