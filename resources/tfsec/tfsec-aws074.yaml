    Amazon S3 has a simple web services interface that you can use to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It gives any developer access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast, inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of web sites.

    AWS S3 by default doesn't allow public access to S3 objects in new buckets. Users can modify bucket policies access point policies, or object permissions to allow public access.

    Enabling the option causes the following behavior:
    * PUT Bucket acl and PUT Object acl calls fail if the specified access control list (ACL) is public.
    * PUT Object calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.
    * If this setting is applied to an account, then PUT Bucket calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.

    #### Description
    Amazon S3 has a simple web services interface that you can use to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It gives any developer access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast, inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of web sites.

    AWS S3 by default doesn't allow public access to S3 objects in new buckets. Users can modify bucket policies access point policies, or object permissions to allow public access.

    Enabling the option causes the following behavior:
    * PUT Bucket acl and PUT Object acl calls fail if the specified access control list (ACL) is public.
    * PUT Object calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.
    * If this setting is applied to an account, then PUT Bucket calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.

    #### Rationale
    With AWS S3 Block Public Access, you can easily set up centralized controls to limit public access to your Amazon S3 resources that are enforced regardless of how the resources are created.

    #### Remediation
    Set `aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block.block_public_acls` to true.

    Terraform example:
    ```
    resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
       bucket = "example"
    }
    resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "example" {
       bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id
    +  block_public_acls   = true
       block_public_policy = true
       ...
       ...
    }
    ```
