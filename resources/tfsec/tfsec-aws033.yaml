description: "Plain HTTP is unencrypted and human-readable. This means that if a malicious actor was to eavesdrop on your connection, they would be able to see all of your data flowing back and forth. You should use HTTPS, which is HTTP over an encrypted (TLS) connection, meaning eavesdroppers cannot read your traffic."

    #### Description
    Amazon ElasticSearch is a fully managed service to help you run, deploy a secure ElasticSearch service cost effectively.
    ElasticSearch helps to store, analyze, and correlate application and infrastructure log data to find and fix issues faster
    and improve application performance. This can contain sensitive information and it should be safely protected, so any
    communication between your client and you domain are done over TLS only.

    #### Rationale
    To ensure that communication between your clients and your domain are encrypted, Amazon ElasticSearch provides the option
    to enforce `https` for all traffic. You can also configure the minimum required TLS version to accept. This is an useful
    security control to ensure your clients are not misconfigured.

    #### Remediation
    Set argument `domain_endpoint_options.enforce_https` to true and also provide the policy for tls.
    Available options for policy:

    * Policy-Min-TLS-1-2-2019-07
    * Policy-Min-TLS-1-0-2019-07

    Terraform will only perform drift detection if a configuration value is provided.

    Terraform example:
    ```
    resource "aws_elasticsearch_domain" "es" {
        domain_name           = var.domain
        elasticsearch_version = "6.3"

        cluster_config {
           instance_type = "m4.large.elasticsearch"
        }
    +   domain_endpoint_options {
    +      enforce_https         = true
    +      tls_security_policy   = "Policy-Min-TLS-1-2-2019-07"
    +   }
        ...
        ...
    }
    ```
