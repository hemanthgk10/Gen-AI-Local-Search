    #### Description
    Ensure that your Amazon Kinesis streams are encrypted. When you send data from your data producers to your data stream,
    Kinesis Data Streams encrypts your data using an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key before storing the data at
    rest. When your Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream reads the data from your data stream, Kinesis Data Streams first
    decrypts the data and then sends it to Kinesis Data Firehose. Kinesis Data Firehose buffers the data in memory based on
    the buffering hints that you specify. It then delivers it to your destinations without storing the unencrypted data at
    rest.

    #### Rationale
    Ensure that your Amazon Kinesis streams are encrypted in order to meet security and
    compliance requirements. Encrypting the data keeps it protected from unathorized access.

    #### Remediation
    Set the `encryption_type` argument to "KMS" in `aws_kinesis_stream`. You also need specify
    `kms_key_id` to encrypt the data.

    Terraform example:
    ```
    resource "aws_kinesis_stream" "test_stream" {
      name             = "terraform-kinesis-test"
      shard_count      = 1
      retention_period = 48

      shard_level_metrics = [
        "IncomingBytes",
        "OutgoingBytes",
      ]
    + encryption_type  = "KMS"
    + kms_key_id       = "alias/aws/kinesis"
      ...
      ...
    }
    ```
