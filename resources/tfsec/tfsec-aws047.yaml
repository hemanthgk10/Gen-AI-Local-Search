description: "SQS Policy actions should always be restricted to a specific set. This ensures that the queue itself cannot be modified or deleted, and prevents possible future additions to queue actions to be implicitly allowed."

    #### Description
    Ensure SQS policies that allow all(*) actions are not created. SQS policies should start with a minimum set of
    actions and include more as needed rather than starting with `*`.

    #### Remediation
    Providing all actions when unnecessary exposes resources to potentially unwanted actions.


    #### Rationale
    Remove Action with `*` and replace it with specific action that is required.

    ```
    resource "aws_sqs_queue" "q" {
      name = "examplequeue"
    }

    resource "aws_sqs_queue_policy" "test" {
        queue_url = aws_sqs_queue.q.id
        policy = <<POLICY
        {
          "Version": "2012-10-17",
          "Id": "sqspolicy",
          "Statement": [
            {
              "Sid": "First",
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Principal": "*",
    -         "Action": "*"
    +         "Action": "sqs:SendMessage",
              "Resource": "${aws_sqs_queue.q.arn}",
              "Condition": {
                "ArnEquals": {
                  "aws:SourceArn": "${aws_sns_topic.example.arn}"
                }
              }
            }
          ]
        }
        POLICY
    }
    ```
