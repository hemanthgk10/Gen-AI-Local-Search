    Amazon S3 has a simple web services interface that you can use to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It gives any developer access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast, inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of web sites.

    The Amazon S3 Block Public Access feature provides settings for access points, buckets, and accounts to help you manage public access to Amazon S3 resources.

    AWS S3 block by default doesn't allow public access to S3 objects in new buckets. Users can modify bucket policies access point policies, or object permissions to allow public access. By enabling `ignore_public_acls`, Amazon S3 blocks public access granted by ACLs while still allowing PUT Object calls that include a public ACL (as opposed to BlockPublicAcls, which rejects PUT Object calls that include a public ACL).

    #### Description
    Amazon S3 has a simple web services interface that you can use to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It gives any developer access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast, inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of web sites.

    The Amazon S3 Block Public Access feature provides settings for access points, buckets, and accounts to help you manage public access to Amazon S3 resources.

    AWS S3 block by default doesn't allow public access to S3 objects in new buckets. Users can modify bucket policies access point policies, or object permissions to allow public access. By enabling `ignore_public_acls`, Amazon S3 blocks public access granted by ACLs while still allowing PUT Object calls that include a public ACL (as opposed to BlockPublicAcls, which rejects PUT Object calls that include a public ACL).

    #### Rationale
    S3 buckets should ignore public ACLs on buckets and any objects they contain. By ignoring rather than blocking, PUT calls with public ACLs will still be applied but the ACL will be ignored.

    #### Remediation
    Set `aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block.ignore_public_acls` to true.

    Terraform example:
    ```
    resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
       bucket = "example"
    }
    resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "example" {
       bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id
       block_public_acls   = true
       block_public_policy = true
    +  ignore_public_acls  = true
       ...
       ...
    }
    ```
