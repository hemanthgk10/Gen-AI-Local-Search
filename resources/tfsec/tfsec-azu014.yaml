    #### Remediation
    Set the attribute `azurerm_storage_account.enable_https_traffic_only` to `true`.

    Terraform example for Azure storage account
    ```
    data "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
        name                      = "packerimages"
        resource_group_name       = "packer-storage"
    -   enable_https_traffic_only = false
    +   enable_https_traffic_only = true
        ...
        ...
    }
