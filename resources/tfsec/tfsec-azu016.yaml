    #### Description
    The Storage Queue service stores messages that may be read by any client who has access to the storage account. A queue can contain an unlimited number of messages, each of which can be up to 64KB in size using version 2011-08-18 or newer. Storage Logging happens server-side and allows details for both successful and failed requests to be recorded in the storage account. These logs allow users to see the details of read, write, and delete operations against the queues. Storage Logging log entries contain the following information about individual requests: Timing information such as start time, end-to-end latency, and server latency, authentication details , concurrency information and the sizes of the request and response messages.

    #### Rationale
    Storage Analytics logs contain detailed information about successful and failed requests to a storage service. This information can be used to monitor individual requests and to diagnose issues with a storage service. Requests are logged on a best-effort basis.
    Storage Analytics logging is not enabled by default for your storage account.

    #### Remediation
    Set the `queue_properties.logging` properties of `read`, `delete` & `write`.

    Terraform example

    ```
      resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
          name                     = "storageaccountname"
          resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
          location                 = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
          account_tier             = "Standard"
          account_replication_type = "GRS"
    +     queue_properties {
    +        logging {
    +            delete             = true
    +            read               = true
    +            write              = true
    +            ...
    +            ...
    +        }
    +     }
          ...
          ...
      }
    ```
    From *Azure Console*
      1. Go to `Storage Accounts`.
      2. Select the specific Storage Account.
      3. Click the `Diagnostics settings` (classic) blade from `Monitoring (classic)` section.
      4. Set the `Status to On`, if set to `Off`.
      5. Select `Queue properties`.
      6. Select `Read, Write and Delete` options under the `Logging` section to enable Storage Logging for Queue service.

    *From CLI*
    Use the below command to enable the Storage Logging for Queue service.

    ```
     az storage logging update --account-name <storageAccountName> --account-key <storageAccountKey> --services q --log rwd --retention 90
    ```

    #### Additional Information
    By the nature and intent of having queues, practically we cannot generalize detailed audit log requirement for every queue. This recommendation may be applicable to storage account queue service where the security is paramount.
